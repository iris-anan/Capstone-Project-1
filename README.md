# Capstone-Project-1

## Introduction

### The Problem:
The modern-day lifestyle has turned into one that revolves around the subscription business model. Nowadays, you can get fresh ingredients delivered to your door, clothes to update your wardrobe, movies and TV shows to watch across different online devices, and even access to a variety of music to listen to during long commutes; all for a reasonable recurring monthly fee. The critical business question is no longer just “How will I find customers for my product?” but will also include “How will I retain my customers?” 

KKBOX, Taiwanese subscription based music streaming service, shared their customer data on Kaggle to learn more about predicting churning. When users signs up for our service, users can choose to either manually renew or auto-renew the service. Users can actively cancel their membership at any time. For this project, the criteria of "churn" is no new valid service subscription within 30 days after the current membership expires.

### The Inquiry:
Can we predict if a user will make a new service subscription transaction within 30 days after the current membership expiration date based on their behaviors and interactions with the product?

### The Client:
The client is KKBOX. KKBOX will be able to use this information to offer special deals to customers who are likely to churn or on the verge of churning.

### Data Files Used:
The data files were too large to be uploaded on github. Please see the Kaggle page **[here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/kkbox-churn-prediction-challenge/data)**
